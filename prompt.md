I am building a mentoring platform to connect mentors and mentees. Its called PeerCodex. The Mentors and Mentees are both high schoolers. The will create an account providing their email, password, first name, last name, date of birth (just the month and year), accept the terms of service and create an account. First he has to click on the verification email that he receives and then he has to click on verified email button on the screen. This will create his login. For now create a dummy landing page. I will provide more functionality. When creating users, also create a user in Users collection in firebase, with the UID, FName, LName, DOB and accepted date, last modified date, role = user.
